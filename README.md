## Project & Technologies
The project we decided to make is a Twin Stick Space Shooter. It's an isometric space shooter that you play with an xbox controller, controlling the movement with the left stick, and
change direction and shoot with the right stick. 
There is asteroids coming at the player and enemy ships that follow the player. 
There is a points system where which each enemy you destroy, the points go up.
Asteroids go have 10 points and enemy ships have 20 points. 
There is no end game, when the player dies it displays the score and asks if the player wants to restart. 
We took inspiration from games like Robotron and Geometry Wars. 
We made the game using Unity and with code done with C#. 
We submitted work we did to a co-shared github repository. 
## Team
Paddy did a lot of the code work. With creating a lot of the fundamentals of the game such as the player, the enemy's and the design.
Tom did some work with the code with the asteroids, some game controller work and some game theory  and helped creating the front end and some of the models.
Tom had two laptops and a desktop hard drive die on him during the building of the game :( , so a lot the opportunity for him to work on the code was through the college 
computers which runs an older version of Unity that what Paddy had on his laptop. This was a bit of a hindrance as we noticed a lot of work we were doing, though the same code, 
was appearing differently on the two versions. This motivated us to meet up and work on the code together when we were available. 
We enjoyed working on this project as Unity was something that neither of us had actually used before. 
It was a new experience that helped us understand game building fundamentals and C#. 
It was also good for us to work using github as it was interesting to be able to work and submit code that way.
